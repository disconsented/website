Resources to evaluate performance of PC parts
=============================================

- http://anandtech.com/Bench/ CPU bench's only, GPU bench's are not updated with drivers.
- http://guru3d.com/
- http://johnnylucky.org/data-storage/ssd-database.html (Thanks Not_Jappetto) SSD's are a little bit special in that the vast majority of workloads will not benefit from a faster drive.
- http://www.gamersnexus.net/
- http://www.legitreviews.com/
- http://www.realhardtechx.com/index_archivos/PSUReviewDatabase.html
- https://www.hardwareunboxed.com/
- https://www.pcper.com/
- https://www.techpowerup.com/
- https://www.techpowerup.com/reviewdb/ Great resource for finding reviews about specific models but be aware of their performance summaries due to driver updates.

Resources NOT to use to evaluate performance
============================================

- http://cpuboss.com/
- http://gpuboss.com/
- http://hwbench.com/
- http://motherboardbenchmark.net/ (this one just uses an arbitrary statistic)
- http://userbenchmark.com/
- http://www.cpubenchmark.net/
- http://www.videocardbenchmark.net/
- http://youtube.com/ (there is too much nonsense on here to filter through, consider most sources terrible until proven otherwise)

These websites primarily use Synthetic Benchmarks [1]_ for comparisons (at this point its better to consider sites terrible until proven otherwise) and as a result do not reflect real world performance [2]_ as well as use statistics like clock rate [3]_ that have no legitimate usage within this scenario. Other sources should be taken with a grain of salt and evaluated against [4]_.
