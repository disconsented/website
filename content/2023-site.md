I finally got off my kester and migrated my personal website to a new theme and SSG, previously, this site was using 
a custom theme based on pure.css and using GetNikola for its SSG. Now it's been migrated towards bulma.css & Zola.

Maybe new articles, we'll see if I get frustrated enough to write them, for now I've written 
[a quick overview](/basics-of-networking/) to understanding the basics of computer networking, from the perspective of 
a self-hoster.

Anyway, enjoy the new site, happy holidays and good luck for 2024!
