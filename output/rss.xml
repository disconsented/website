&lt;h2&gt;Hardware is Hard&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A guide to understanding and choosing hardware for Minecraft servers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The topic of server hardware appears quite frequently in &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://reddit.com/r/syscraft"&gt;/r/syscraft&lt;/a&gt;. Sadly, this is poorly misunderstood and is at times hard to research. This article serves to help guide you through choosing the hardware for your server be it a dedicated server or a system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;N.B.:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;This guide presumes you're proficient with a sensible server OS(Linux) and have an appropriate network connection. It will not discuss anything about running said server, that is a whole topic of its own.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

However, Coffee Lake-R and Turing have both entered the fray. It has been an exciting few months to say the least. On the plus side Pascal, Polaris and Vega are at sensible prices again.&lt;/p&gt;

Odly
enough it is about 3Gb/s which is well within SATA 3's practical limit of 4.4Gb/s, its quite safe to put the myth that Video Editing is a workload that benefits from NVMe to rest.&lt;/p&gt;

Pinnacle Ridge and Raven Ridge have both been released into the wild along with Intel's reactive motherboard's (B360, H310 and H370) and CPUs (i5-8600). All up this has been a somewhat exciting couple of months since the last guide, PR narrows the gap with both clocks and IPC (thanks to AMD's improvements to the cache &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/12625/amd-second-generation-ryzen-7-2700x-2700-ryzen-5-2600x-2600/4"&gt;espically L2&lt;/a&gt;) but this ultimately doesn't change my person recommendations of if it's not an 8700k go with Zen.&lt;/p&gt;
