&lt;p&gt;I want to make it clear that I only wish to maintain and work on one version myself (although I am open to someone else maintaining a 1.7.10 version) this was for a few reasons, the biggest being that I have become a professional software developer and modding is as much of a hobby as something of a passion (still being a full time student doesn't help) so I don't have as much time as before to work on it.
There are other reasons, the most prominent being that a few mods that I have had my eye on for compatibility issues like Tinkers Construct have been undergoing major changes to the code base and I do not wish to work against it until it is stable again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, the modding community stagnates around Minecraft versions and I loathe that. If I can push it along ever so slightly I am perfectly happy to do so (even at the cost of people’s perceptions and enjoyment).&lt;/p&gt;
