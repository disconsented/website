Resources to evaluate performance of PC parts

Databases and miscellaneous
###########################

| http://johnnylucky.org/data-storage/ssd-database.html (Thanks Not_Jappetto) SSD's are a little bit special in that the vast majority of workloads will not benefit from a faster drive.
| http://www.realhardtechx.com/index_archivos/PSUReviewDatabase.html
| https://www.techpowerup.com/reviewdb/ Great resource for finding reviews about specific models but be aware of their performance summaries due to driver updates.

Resources NOT to use to evaluate performance
============================================

| https://www.pcper.com/ [5]_
| http://cpuboss.com/
| http://gpuboss.com/
| http://hwbench.com/
| http://motherboardbenchmark.net/ (this one just uses an arbitrary statistic)
| http://userbenchmark.com/ [6]_
| http://www.cpubenchmark.net/
| http://www.videocardbenchmark.net/
| http://youtube.com/ (there is too much nonsense on here to filter through, consider most sources terrible until proven otherwise)
| http://thebottlenecker.com/

These websites primarily use Synthetic Benchmarks [1]_ for comparisons (at this point its better to consider sites 
terrible until proven otherwise) and as a result do not reflect real world performance [2]_ as well as use statistics 
like clock rate [3]_ that have no legitimate usage within this scenario. Other sources should be taken with a grain of 
salt and evaluated against [4]_. These sites also tend to suffer from unregulation of results, verification of results 
and self-selection bias.
