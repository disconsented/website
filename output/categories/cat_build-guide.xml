However, Coffee Lake-R and Turing have both entered the fray. It has been an exciting few months to say the least. On the plus side Pascal, Polaris and Vega are at sensible prices again.&lt;/p&gt;

Pinnacle Ridge and Raven Ridge have both been released into the wild along with Intel's reactive motherboard's (B360, H310 and H370) and CPUs (i5-8600). All up this has been a somewhat exciting couple of months since the last guide, PR narrows the gap with both clocks and IPC (thanks to AMD's improvements to the cache &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/12625/amd-second-generation-ryzen-7-2700x-2700-ryzen-5-2600x-2600/4"&gt;espically L2&lt;/a&gt;) but this ultimately doesn't change my person recommendations of if it's not an 8700k go with Zen.&lt;/p&gt;
