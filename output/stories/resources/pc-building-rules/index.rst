.. type: text

1. Systems should be balanced.
	a. Don't match an i7 with an low end GPU and vice versa.
2. Parametric filters are amazing.
	a. Seriously!
3. Only CPU overclock(O.C.) once you have a T1 GPU (1080).
	a. Overclocking (Z### for intel) motherboards and aftermarket coolers are also required for this.
4. Brand loyalty only hurts.
	a. Companies can have bad and good products even within the same product lines.
	b. Customer service varys from dat to day.
5. You don’t need more than 16GB of RAM.
	a. High clock rate memory should only be considered when you're already overclocking (preformance gains are normally minimal).
	b. You only buy 4GB DIMM’s (sticks) when you can afford 4GB MAX.
6. GPU is king.
	a. Performance today is the only thing that really matters.
	b. However for a given GPU you should only select the cheapest non-blower design.
7. PSU wattage only needs to be 100w over what pcpartpicker states.
	a. Good PSU’s tend to start at 500w+.
	b. You don’t need platinum or titanium efficiency (use Gold/Bronze depending on the budget).
8. PCI-e based SSD’s are not worth the cost over SATA SSD's.
	a. Expensive HDD’s (WD Black) provide nothing of real value over cheaper models.
	b. There is no valid data on HDD reliability.
	c. Every build should have a (SATA) SSD of some kind.
9. Cases are personal.
	a. mITX is a premium option and isn't recommended as a result.
	b. Windowless chassis allows you to have smart part choices and still have a nice looking build.
10. Select the cheapest motherboard that fits based off the features you need.
	a. You don’t need ATX, get mATX.
	b. B150 is the go to chipset (unless H170 quad DIMM slots are the same price/cheaper).
	c. H110 is generally too limiting to be used with anything but the lowest budgets.
11. Soundcard’s are redundant, buy external equipment if on-board audio is genuinely not good enough.
12. Futureproofing is not a thing, generational release cycles see to that.
	a. Seriously.
	b. No please stop mentioning it.
13. Dont forget your peripherals!
	a. Monitor's will last several builds (don't forget adaptive sync when considering your GPU).
	b. A good chair is critical for a pain free experience.
14. Pcparpticker is the best resouce for putting your system together.
	a. Don't forget to change your localisation if you live outside the U.S.A.
