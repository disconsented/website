* Unless you have a T1 GPU (980ti or Fury-X) or a legitimate use case (these are rare) DO NOT CPU OVERCLOCK YOU CAN BETTER SPEND THE MONEY ELSE WHERE.
* Any amount of 4GB DIMM's (Sticks), literally the only reason for this is when you can afford *only* 4GB total.
* GTX-970. Get a R9-390 it preforms better for about the same price and has double the VRAM.
* GTX-960. Get a R9-380 it preforms better for about the same price.
* WD Black HDD's, these provide no real benefit over Seagate Barracudas or WD Blue's. DONT GET THEM.
* Kingston V300, these are terrible drives that Kingston preformed a bait and switch on (review versions are different and much better than what you buy).
* Cooler Master Hyper 212 EVO, the only reason why you would want this is for CPU overclocking however if you're spending money that way you should be doing it properly and getting a not cheap cooler.
