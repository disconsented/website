.. [#] Does anyone have X?
.. [#] Google question.
.. [#] CPU overclocking without a T1 GPU.
.. [#] FO4 builds.
.. [#] Backblaze/Seagate.

- [#]_ "Does anyone have X?" is a poor question because: 1) It is almost always a preface to another question 2) Just because someone might not have your exact setup doesn't mean they're unable to help. Variations of this include "Does anyone know about X?".
- [#]_ Google question is better answered by Google because:
    - Opinion questions: Google will deliver a wider range of information faster. 
    - Simple questions: Google will answer the question faster without bothering other people.
- [#]_ For gaming, CPU overclocking provides very little benefit (`even in "CPU intensive" games like ARMA 3 <http://www.techspot.com/articles-info/712/bench/CPU_01.png>`_) and instead that money should always be put into the GPU (unless you're using a T1 GPU like a 980ti, Fury-X or equivalent).
- [#]_ See the `GamersNexus Article <http://www.gamersnexus.net/game-bench/2177-fallout-4-pc-video-card-fps-benchmark-all-resolutions>`_ for benchmarks (TL;DR 380 for 1080p medium, 970 or 390(with max tessellation set to 16x) needed for 1080p ultra, 390x or 980 for 1440p ultra, SLI 980ti or Crossfire Fury-X for 4K). For CPU's anything like a i5-6500 or better will be sufficient `see the GamersNexus article <http://www.gamersnexus.net/game-bench/2182-fallout-4-cpu-benchmark-huge-performance-difference>`_ for more information.
- [#]_  `(1) <http://www.tweaktown.com/articles/6028/dispelling-backblaze-s-hdd-reliability-myth-the-real-story-covered/index.html>`_ , `(2) <https://www.backblaze.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/blog_q3stats_manufacturer-e1444680042365.jpg>`_     TL;DR There is nothing wrong with Seagate drives anyone who claims otherwise is likely using Backblaze as a source (even they agree there are no issues now), using annecdote or are being dishonest `(remember their market share) <http://www.forbes.com/sites/tomcoughlin/2015/01/29/hdd-annual-unit-shipments-increase-in-2014/>`_.
