.. [#] Does anyone have X?
.. [#] Google question.

- [#]_ "Does anyone have X?" is a poor question because: 1) It is almost always a preface to another question 2) Just because someone might not have your exact setup doesn't mean they're unable to help. Variations of this include "Does anyone know about X?".
- [#]_ Google question is better answered by Google because:
    - Opinion questions: Google will deliver a wider range of information faster. 
    - Simple questions: Google will answer the question faster without bothering other people.
