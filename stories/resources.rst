PC Building

`How should I choose my RAM? </stories/how-should-i-choose-my-ram/>`_

`Brand. </stories/brand/>`_

`Evaluating performance. </stories/evaluating-performance/>`_

`Common build issues. </stories/common-pc-build-issues/>`_

`IRC notes. </stories/irc-notes/>`_

`Choosemypc.net (Cookie cutter PC build generator) <http://choosemypc.net/>`_
..

    N.B. This website is amazing and is the single best resource for building a pc (it also gives you pcpartpicker links).

`Megahertz Myth. <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megahertz_myth>`_

Backblaze/Seagate. `(1) <http://www.tweaktown.com/articles/6028/dispelling-backblaze-s-hdd-reliability-myth-the-real-story-covered/index.html>`_ ,
`(2) <https://www.backblaze.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/blog_q3stats_manufacturer-e1444680042365.jpg>`_
..

    TL;DR There is nothing wrong with Seagate drives anyone who claims otherwise is likely using Backblaze as a source (even they agree there are no issues now), using annecdote or are being dishonest `(remember their market share) <http://www.forbes.com/sites/tomcoughlin/2015/01/29/hdd-annual-unit-shipments-increase-in-2014/>`_.

`Freenode ##windows IRC resources. <http://www.freenode-windows.org/resources>`_

`How to ask a smart question. <http://faculty.gvc.edu/ssnyder/121/Goodquestions.html>`_
