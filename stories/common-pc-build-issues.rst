Storage
-------

* Drive does not appear in the bios

This is either one of two things: 1) The drive does not have data and/or power plugged in 2) the drive is dead.

* Drive does not appear in Windows

Drives need to be formatted before they can be used, Seagate [1]_ has a good resource on this topic.

Graphics Card
-------------

* No video

Possible causes

    #. Video out is not plugged into the GPU.
    #. GPU does not have all of its external power connectors populated.
    #. Monitor is not using the correct video input
    #. GPU fault (aka contact the manufacturer for further trouble shooting steps)
